Mongolian Cyrillic to Roman Converter

Mongolians often use Roman Letters for Texting.

This program converts Cyrillic to Roman letters.

Some variations exist and you may edit the replacement list accordingly.

N.B.: The letters Ү and Ө of the Mongolian alphabet can be copied, but not typed into Python IDLE due to an unfortunate bug.
